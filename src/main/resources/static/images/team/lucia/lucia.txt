I am Lucía Prieto Santamaría, I am 22 years old and I am currently finishing my degree in Biotechnology at the Technical University of Madrid. I have specialized in Computational Biotechnology and, if all goes well, I hope to be able to finish my degree in July 2018 and next year to continue in this field studying the Master's degree in Computational Biology at this university. During this academic year I have been doing the external curricular internships dedicating myself to the DISNET project, and my end-of-grade work is also included in this project. The part I worked on was the creation of the biological layer of the network, the insertion of its information and the calculation of the similarities between diseases. On a personal level, I've been doing rhythmic gymnastics since I was a little girl and it's still one of my great hobbies, not as a gymnast but as a trainer. 

My academic e-mail address is lucia.prieto.santamaria@alumnos.upm.es.
